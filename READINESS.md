## production readiness evaluation

### readiness levels

- **level 0**: not ready for production
- **level 1**: minimally viable for production, high-risk
- **level 2**: production ready with acceptable risk
- **level 3**: production ready with comprehensive controls

### evaluation criteria by level

#### level 1 requirements (minimally viable)

- all high priority infrastructure components implemented
- basic observability with metrics, logging, and alerting
- essential security controls (iam, encryption, network)
- documented upgrade and incident response procedures
- backup capabilities

#### level 2 requirements (standard production)

- all level 1 requirements
- all high and medium priority items in all categories
- automated security controls and policy enforcement
- comprehensive monitoring with slos
- regular dr testing
- full ci/cd pipeline for infrastructure

#### level 3 requirements (enterprise production)

- all level 1 and 2 requirements
- all items across all categories, regardless of priority
- advanced features like chaos engineering
- comprehensive compliance documentation
- advanced cost optimization
- automated remediation for common issues

## current readiness assessment

based on the checkboxes above:

- [⬜] level 1 readiness:
    - missing: backup & restore, pod security, network policies, cluster upgrades, node rotation, incident response,
      change management, security scanning

- [⬜] level 2 readiness:
    - missing all level 1 gaps plus: policy enforcement, slo tracking, secret rotation, dr testing, capacity planning,
      infrastructure testing, drift detection, compliance checks

- [⬜] level 3 readiness:
    - missing all level 2 gaps plus: service mesh, external dns, cost estimation

## action plan summary

1. **focus on level 1 gaps first:**
    - implement backup solution
    - add pod security standards
    - implement network policies
    - document and test cluster upgrade procedures
    - create incident response and change management workflows

2. **then address level 2 items:**
    - implement policy enforcement
    - set up slo tracking and monitoring
    - create secret rotation mechanisms
    - develop and test dr procedures
    - add infrastructure testing and compliance checks

3. **finally complete level 3 requirements:**
    - evaluate service mesh needs
    - implement external dns integration
    - add cost management tools
    - implement advanced features

## certification process

- [ ] level 1 certification complete
- [ ] level 2 certification complete
- [ ] level 3 certification complete

**current status**: progressing toward level 1 production readiness
